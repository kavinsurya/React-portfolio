                    Being a Electronics Engineering student involves identifying a
                    problem and coming up with a technological solution to address it.
                    I love to try to catch the ability to solve complex problems in a logical way.
                    Since coming up with a solution of a problem is never a straightforward process,
                    out of the box thinking is often required in order to ensure delivering the most
                    innovative and effective solutions.
